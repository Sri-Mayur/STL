## Introduction

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of template classes and functions in C++ designed to make programming more efficient and convenient. It provides general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and maps.

## Components of STL

STL is divided into several components, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Algorithms**: Generic algorithms like sorting, searching, and more.
- **Containers**: Data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks.
- **Functions**: Function objects and lambda expressions.
- **Iterators**: Generalized pointers that allow algorithms to work with different data structures.
- **Utilities**: Various utility classes and functions.
